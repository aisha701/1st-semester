        <h2><u>ART GALLERY</u></h2>
        
      </div> <hr>Art has always been a significant part of our life. It is ingrained in a human being in several forms. Art exists in the form of dressing, preparing food, communicating, performing any creation such as drama, painting, music, sculpting etc. From time immemorial, people have been looking at, creating, enjoying, and criticizing art.

It is a genuine curiosity of what an art is, its objective, and why it has existed in modern time. Art is what a spectator brings to it. It can be enjoyment, or sadness. Art is as a way to express yourself, and how they feel the world around them. The Art plays a major role in expressing inner beauty, and thoughts. From music, to dance, we use arts as a medium to touch that part that we can’t reach with the help of science.

So, let us know what exactly an art is. Art isn’t something that we have to study in order to understand and relish it. It is something that simply captures our attention. Whether you try to communicate via an emotion, or an idea, the very important thing that you need to know is how well your audience receives your artistic creation.

Art can even be shocking. It is a creative piece that an artist uses to spur the discussion among people. Art also inspires people and motivates them with incredible meaning hidden behind it. It even transports people into different world of reality, and move us into subconscious locations that we have no idea that it existed.
